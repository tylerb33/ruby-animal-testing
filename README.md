# Testing the Animals - NSS Exercise

1. Copy the contents of [animals.rb](./assets/animals.rb) into the file you just created.

## Overview

As a team, we'll be building unit test coverage for all the functionality of the code in the `animal` module. We'll discuss how writing tests often affect the implementation code, and how to think bout covering edge cases in your test suit.

## Instructions

Write test cases to verify the I/O of the following methods of `Animal` and `Dog`.

1. In the test class' `setup` method, create an instance of `Animal` and `Dog`.
1. Animal object has the correct `name` property.
1. Set a species and verify that the object property of `species` has the correct value.
1. Invoking the `walk` method set the correct speed on the both objects.
1. The animal object is an instance of `Animal`.
1. The dog object is an instance of `Dog`.

## To Run

```
ruby test_animals.rb
```
